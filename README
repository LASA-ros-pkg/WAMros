*** wamros Node Description ***

wamros is a ROS (ros.org) node for controlling the WAM robot
arm. wamros provides the following services:

/wam/active_passive
/wam/goHome
/wam/moveToPos 
/wam/moveToCart -- move tool to a cartesian coordinate
/wam/switchMode -- switches between joint/cartesian control space

wamros subscribes to the following topics:

/wam/joints_command
/wam/cartesian_command -- in internal units

wamros produces for the following topics:

/wam/joints_sensed
/wam/status
/wam/cartesian_coordinates -- in meters
/wam/homogeneous_matrix -- different representation of cartesian coordinates
/wam/cartesian_targets -- in internal units

*** Getting Started ***

See start.sh for an example of how to start a wamros node. Note that
you are required to set the _wamconf parameter. The _doinit parameter
is optional and tells wamros to perform a small test motion at
startup.

*** Build Instructions ***

Provided your ROS_PACKAGE_PATH and all the dependencies are set up
properly, building wamros may be as simple as running: 

rosmake wamros

This node requires that xenomai and btclient are already
installed. Please update CMakeLists.txt with the include and lib
directories for both those dependencies.
