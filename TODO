Roadmap for WAMros:

1) Report and accept endpoint coordinates (cartesian).

2) Report and accept torques.

3) Transition to libbarrett

4) Add hand support


Known issues:

7 DOF is hardcoded, allow for 4.
Proper cleanup on shutdown:
       * thread join
       * delete the mutex
       * optional: return to home position
